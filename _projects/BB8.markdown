# Star Wars BB8 Project

# Overview

Back in sophomore year of my undergraduate study at Carnegie Mellon I competed in a week-long build-a-thon known as Build18. During the build-a-thon we were give $300 dollars, and told to build something cool for the first week of the spring semester. I decided to recreate a life size version of the popular Star Wars BB8 robot. I was the lead mechanical engineer for the project and work alongside 4 computer science majors to complete the project. 

# Building the Robot

The robot does this using on board sensing with an IMU (inertial measurement unit), beging control by an arduino mega 2560.

# Awards

For the work we did we won two awards:

1. Lockheed Martin Innovation Award
2. Rockwell Automation Award
