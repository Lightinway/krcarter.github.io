## Star Wars BB8 Project

---

# Overview

---

Back in sophomore year of my undergraduate study at Carnegie Mellon I competed in a week-long build-a-thon known as Build18. During the build-a-thon we were give $300 dollars and told to build something cool for the first week of the spring semester. I decided to recreate a life size version of the popular Star Wars BB8 robot. I was the lead mechanical engineer for the project and work alongside 4 computer science majors to complete the project. The robot during the build-a-thon did not successfully balance at the time, but it did win us some awards. I then went back and reengineering the robot as a case-study in controls senior year in my class, 24-451 Feedback Control Systems.

The projects was greatly inspired by youtuber [James Bruton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlwcXgZYImU) who does incredible work.

The robot does this using on board sensing with an IMU (inertial measurement unit), beging control by an arduino mega 2560.

# Awards

For the work we did we won two awards:

1. Lockheed Martin Innovation Award
