# Overview
<br />

During high school I had the pleasure of being part of FIRST robotics through team 321 the Robolancers. My time on my high school robotics team is the reason why I got into robotics, and it push me to study mechanical engineering and robotics in college. I was on the team from the very first meeting my freshman year in 2011 to my senior year of high school in 2015. During my junior and senior year, I was elected mechanical lead. As mechanical lead I led over 50 students in the design, fabrication, and building a 120-pound robot.
