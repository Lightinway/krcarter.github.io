# Overview
<br />

For my engineering design 1 class we made a gripper that objective was to hold onto a 2lb fidget spinner. The gripper had to with a high dynamic load while being as light as possible.

Structurally, the gripper consists of two plates connected by three rigid rods.  The top plate serves as the interface between the robot wrist and the gripper, and also as the mounting for the mechanisms to close the gripper.  The bottom plate serves as the mounting point for the 3-pronged gripper claw.  The claw is an assembly comprised of three “fingers” that rotate around blocks attached to the bottom plate. The fingers are kept at an open angle by springs.  Each finger is kinked slightly, forming a knuckle.  A high friction gripping pad is attached to the fingertips to grip the fidget spinner at the tapered curves in the center.

To operate the gripper, the motor drive shaft is attached to a gear that drives a second gear centered on an axle.  The axle is held by two bearings on rods attached to the top plate and connects the gear to a spool. The center plate is attached to the spool by one cable. Each knuckle has a cable on the inner side attaching it to the center plate as well.  When the motor runs, the spool pulls the center plate up, which pulls the fingers closed.  When the claw is closed, the springs connected to the fingers are in tension.  When the cables are released, the springs return to equilibrium, holding the claw open.

We chose this design because it is simple and minimizes mass. Cables are lighter than rods and gears to open/close the claws. It is also comprised of simple parts that are easy to manufacture. The driving mechanism is simple, with only two gears and an axle.

# Prototype Designs

A lot of the prototyping we did was optimizing the fingers to grab the fidget spinner.
