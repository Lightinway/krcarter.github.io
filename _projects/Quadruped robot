Project for my junior year engineering Design I class. Task was to design and build a robot to traverse stairs, rocks, and hills just with one motor. We designed our robot to have the same walking gait as a dog.

The robot we built had one of the highest scores, and was extremely fast in traversing through the rocks.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/biped_gif1.gif" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/biped_gif2.gif" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/LegLengths.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>

On the top, a simulation of the robot gait. Middle, dog walking gait we are modeling from. bottom, dimensions of four-bar linkage system.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>

<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/4.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>
