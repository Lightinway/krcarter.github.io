# Overview
<br />

My team worked together to build and optimized a walking robot for search and rescue operations in confined space. The robot was powered by a single motor, and legs of the robot consist of four identical four bar linkages. We designed our robot to have an animal gait mimicking a dog trot. To do this we planned for our four-bar linkage mechanism to follow a sideways “D”. In our simulation we got our desired curved close, but not exact.
